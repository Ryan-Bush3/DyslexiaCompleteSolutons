                    <p class="d-grid gap-2 col-lg-7 mx-auto text">Dyslexia Complete Solutions began as a part time effort to earn some extra income for a
                    single mom. As students learned to read with the bonus of reduced anxiety and increased self-
                     esteem, it quickly became a passion and mission to reach as many struggling readers as
                    possible. Tutors were added, students were added, more study and research became an
                    obsession, along with a vision of reaching as many struggling readers as possible.
                    DCS utilizes science and evidence-based practices to teach students to read. We have
                    taught children and adults of all ages. Most of our tutors come from communication disorders
                    college programs, students in graduate Speech and Language Pathology courses, future
                    pediatricians, future school psychologists, and future neuropsychologists. Training in dyslexia
                    and science of reading practices is ongoing with the tutors. Establishing rapport and good
                    relationships with our students are fostered in order to work together effectively. Trust is
                    important in these relationships as well.</p>
